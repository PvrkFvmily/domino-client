## Project Pitch and description 
The year is 2023 and to some people's surprise, Twitter died. In its place, a new social media has sprung up. McFaceBook is a blog-style social media app that lets users post their thoughts and commenters can wage flame wars against each other in the comment sections (if it exists ðŸ¤«).
